        <li>Peel skins and cut the vegetables into small cubes.</li>
        <li>Put them in a strainer and squeeze to remove excess of juices. Transfer them to a bowl.</li>

        <li>Add everything to the roasted vegetables, add vinegar, olive oil, and salt (to taste).</li>
        <li>Mix and transfer to a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Let stay in a fridge for 30 min. and enjoy.</li>
